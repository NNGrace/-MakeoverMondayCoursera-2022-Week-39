The visualization seeks to display the average internet speed across Europe using Tableau. 
Data Source: Speedtest by Ookla Global Fixed and Mobile Network Performance Maps. The spreadsheet will be attached.
This visualization is in completion of a course I am currently taking to improve my tableau skills. I created the diagram using a map visual, I tried to refine the colours so it does not look too plain and added tooltip to provide you with more information regarding each country.
